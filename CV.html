          <h6><b>PhD Thesis: </b>Mathematical Modelling of Radiotherapy Cancer Treatments</h6>
          <p> My thesis is concerned with brachytherapy; a type of radiation therapy where radioactive sources are placed directly onto the tumour to be treated. The aim of my research is to find the optimal configuration of the sources such that radiation damage on organs in the vicinity of the tumour is minimised, but the tumour still gets the required amount of radiation. This is done by developing a mathematical model which incorporates both the physical equations governing the system, and also real-life patient data. Main mathematical areas include: partial differential equations, inverse problems, numerical optimisation, finite element method, data assimilation. </p>

          <p>I was awarded the opportunity to conduct a research project at the University of Limerick under a Science and Engineering Bursary.

The objective of this project was to learn how to approximately model ultrasound waves, using a combination of partial differential equations, 					geometry and asymptotic analysis and to show how scattered ultrasound waves may be used to detect tumours in human tissue. I also created a basic simulation and imaging algorithm 				based on this theory using MATLAB. Some of my responsibilities included:</p>

          <h6 class="w3-text-theme-dark"><i class="fa fa-calendar fa-fw w3-margin-right"></i>January 2022 - July 2022</h6>
          <p> I was part of the organising committee for the 6th Annual SAMBa Conference <a href="https://people.bath.ac.uk/ss2767/SAMBa-Conf-2022.html"><b>(website)</b></a>, held at the University of Bath on July 5th and 6th (website). This is the annual conference for the SAMBa (Statistical Applied Mathematics at Bath) CDT, which is organised by a group of second year SAMBa students each year.
             This was an invaluable experience which I learnt a lot from. My favourite achievements from this undertaking were: </p>
	        <ul>
            <li>Designing the conference programme: <a href="/files/SAMBa Conference Program_2022.pdf"><b>(see here)</b></a>. This programme was extremely well received by the attendees of the conference and was praised for its professional look, focus on participant wellbeing, and the puzzle corner.</li>
	          <li>Designing the conference mugs. This year we started a new tradition and ran a competition for our students contributing to the conference to submit a figure which will appear in their presentation/poster with the chance of it appearing on the conference mugs.
              I chose the winners and designed the collage of the winners images <a href="/images/Mug_design_SAMBaConf2022.png"><b>(see here)</b></a>
            </li>
            <li> 
              I organised and ran the student lightning talk sessions for our first year SAMBa students.

          <h6 class="w3-text-theme-dark"><i class="fa fa-calendar fa-fw w3-margin-right"></i>March 2022, June 2023</h6>
          <p> I’ve had the privilege of designing and delivering two RI maths masterclasses for year 8 students at the University of Bath. The first masterclass in March 2022 was "Maths of Music". I co-designed this masterclass with other PhD students in my department. In this session, we introduced the maths of how music is made: from soundwaves, how music is played on a guitar, and the mathematical reasoning behind why certain notes played together sound pleasing to the ear. The masterclass finished with a workshop where the children made their own 'guitars' using a box, pencils and a rubber band, and the knowledge they learned about octaves and perfect fifths. 

          The second masterclass I designed and delivered myself and was part of the RI summer special held at Bath. This masterclass was titled “Spirographs: The maths that links art and space”. In this session, I introduced what spirographs are, how to calculate how many points a spirograph will have, and the planets make spirograph patterns when you trace their orbit relative to the Earth. The students has the opportunity to play with the spirographs and see if their patterns match the formulas given, and make their own planet orbits.

          <p> I volunteered as one of the original facilitators for the SOPHia Project (<a href = "http://sophiaphysics.ie/"><i>website</i></a>). This is a University of Limerick initiative where undergraduate students deliver workshops to secondary school students, promoting physics as a subject, particularily to girls and underrepresented genders, in an effort to improve the gender balance in physics in the long-run. During my time with the SOPHia project I visted six different schools and spoke to classes of all ages, ranging from 5th class (age 10) to 4th year (age 16). In this role I delivered physics concepts in a very accessible way, while also conducting some demonstrations and having the students participate also. My favourite part of these workshops were when we would give the students boomwhackers and have them play "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star". Overall this was a thoroughly enjoyable experience and fostered my love for outreach.  </p>

          <p> As part of my MRes degree, I was required to take part in a student-led seminar series. I volunteered to co-organise this in the second semester, which was conducted fully online.

          <p> I was the class representative for 4th Year Mathematics and Physics during my final year of my Bachelor's degree. In this position I acted as a liason between my peers and the academic staff. My main duty was to communicate with our lectururs about any issues we may have as a class such as assignment deadlines. That year in particular was quite challenging as everything suddenly moved online and there was a lot of uncertainty around how we would be assessed. </p>
